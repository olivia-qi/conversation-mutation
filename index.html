        <p style="color:gray">Connection to my life: This game draws an analogy between DNA mutations and the choices we make every day in our interactions with each other. The different types of DNA mutations-- missense, nonsense, silent, and frameshift-- cause butterfly effect in our cells, just like how everything we say causes a butterfly effect in our life. In this game, you can pick between "wildtype" choices that lead to a good ending or options labeled as "mutated" that may or may not lead to other endings.</p>
